ES6 Library skeleton
====================

Javascript boilerplate as a starting point to build ES6 libraries. 

It comes with:
* Babel
* Webpack
* Jest
* Preact
 
[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is an awesome 3k alternative to
React with the same API. And `preact-render-spy` for snapshot testing. 

## Commands:
* `npm run dev`
* `npm run build`
* `npm run build:min`
* `npm run test` or `npm t`
